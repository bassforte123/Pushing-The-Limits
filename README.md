# PushingTheLimits
An Enter the Gungeon mod that allows changing various limiting settings within the game.  Accessed through the Options menu under MOD CONFIG.  Generally the first option after Vanilla will work as a minor tweek that adds some power without completely breaking the balance, but be sure to set to taste.

Settings can be changed mid run if desired.  Menu can occasionally get stuck, if so then you'll need to either reopen the menu or restart the game.

SETTINGS

Rainbow Run Start:
Edits how Rainbow Run works so that you can get some of the benifits of Rainbow Run without losing access to every other item.  Can be set low to serve as an initial boost to normal runs or high to just have an even more powerful version of Rainbow Run.

Rainbow Run Co-Op Chest:
Spawns a second Rainbow Chest during all versions of Rainbow Run if you're in Co-Op Mode.

Synergy Chest Success Rate:
Allows you to increase the odds a Synergy Chest succeeds in dropping a synergy completing item.

Synergy Chests have Normal Chest Fuse Rate:
Disables the original behavior of making natural Synergy Chests always have a fuse.

Synergy Factor:
Increases the effect of the hidden Synergy Factor stat which increases the chance of getting at least one or two synergies in a run.

Magnificence:
Reduces the effect of the hidden Magnificence stat which makes A and S rank items become less and less likely to appear, especially after the first one.

Breakable Wall Strength:
Infinite ammo guns can crack breakable walls the same as normal guns.

Boss DPS Cap:
Lets you reduce or increase the effect of the Boss DPS Cap which prevents most powerful builds from killing bosses too quickly.




Special Thanks to the Mod the Gungeon Discord and especially SpecialAPI and Captain Pretzel whom were tremendously helpful in giving advice and giving a framework to build off of.
